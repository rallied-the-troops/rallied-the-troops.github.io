  <h1>Terraria Weapons Progression Guide for Pre-Hardmode</h1>
  <h2>Ranger</h2>
  <p>Ranger progression is relatively straightforward in Pre-Hardmode, as you'll always have a weapon for each stage and sub-stage of the game. Once you start, you can craft a bow and arrows directly from a wood and stone. For extra damage and effects, you can upgrade them into Frostburn Arrows or Jester's Arrows once you obtain ice and fallen stars. These arrows are reliable enough to last you right before Hardmode or even Post-Hardmode. Getting basic armor and a better bow allows you to rush the Evil biomes and break a Shadow Orb or Crimson Heart, unlocking a gun. Alternatively, you could instead rush the Jungle and get the boomstick from underground chests. The Arms Dealer will move in once you get a gun, and so you can farm for gold to buy the minishark, a gun that will last all of Pre-Hardmode. Rush the Dessert to obtain fossils for the Fossil Armor, and you can take on Skeletron, obtain the handgun to make a Pheonix Blaster and a Shadow Key to unlock the Hellwing Bow. You'll also unlock bones to craft the Necro Armor, the last armor set for rangers in Pre-Hardmode. For the arrows, Jester's and Hellfire Arrows will work until you get better ones in Hardmode.</p>
  <h2>Mage</h2>
  <p>Mages don't have a very linear progression (and if they do, it's far too slow to be effective), and so the key to getting gear fast is to use other class equipment before getting yours. A gun from rushing an evil would do well enough for you to infiltrate the Jungle, where you can farm for the Jungle armor. It may take a while, but it's extremely useful as you don't need another set of armor for the rest of Pre-Hardmode. It also provides a great deal of defense and bonuses when compared to other armors at the stage you can obtain it. The next step is to farm for the Demon Scythe in the Underworld, which may also take a while but is equally useful in terms of weaponry as the Jungle Armor is to its stage. Once you get these two gears, you're practically set to take on the Wall of Flesh, though getting a Flamelash is recommended as it is the best weapon for early Hardmode.</p>
